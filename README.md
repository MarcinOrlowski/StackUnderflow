 1. indicates whenever user is on your blacklist ![blacklisted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcinOrlowski/StackUnderflow/master/img/user-blacklisted-on.png) or not ![not blacklisted](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcinOrlowski/StackUnderflow/master/img/user-blacklisted-off.png)
 2. indicates whenever you consider this user your favourite (starred) one ![starred](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcinOrlowski/StackUnderflow/master/img/user-favourite-on.png) or just regular one ![regular user](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcinOrlowski/StackUnderflow/master/img/user-favourite-off.png). 

To toggle state of each feature, simply tap corresponding icon. If unsure what would happen, hoover mouse pointer over it to see the tooltip with more information.

Note: when you blacklist starred user, s/he will be only considered blacklisted from now one, but star flag will not be be altered, which means once user is removed from blacklist, s/he become will be considered starred again. If you do not want this to take place, you must remove star manually.

All questions asked by either your favourite users will be additionally marked:

### Configuration
 As for now configuration features are limited and there's no configuration dialog yet. Some features are however configurable directly in the script, so once installed, open script for edit and you can find all `cfg_....` parameters at the beginig of the script. Tweak as you need, save and reload target StackOverflow page.
