### Configuration
 As for now configuration features are limited and there's no configuration dialog yet. Some features are however configurable directly in the script, so once installed, open script for edit and you can find all `cfg_....` parameters at the beginig of the script. Tweak as you need, save and reload target StackOverflow page.

### Future
I created this script with my needs in mind, however I hope you find it useful too. If you find a bug, feel free to report it or send pull request. If you miss a feature, use GitHub "issues" to let me know.
